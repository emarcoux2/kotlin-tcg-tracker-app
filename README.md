*TCG Tracker*

TCG Tracker is a Pokémon Trading Card Game companion app built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose,

interact with card sets and series. Authentication is handled with Firebase Auth, and data 
is sourced from the TCGdex API.

Features:
- Browse all Pokémon cards with detailed information.
- View Pokémon card sets and series.
- Manage a personal card collection.
- Mark cards as favorites.
- Search for cards by name.
- Firebase Authentication for login, sign-up, and anonymous guest sessions.
- Room database for offline caching.
- Modular MVVM architecture.

Note: Some features, like OCR Technology and database functionality are currently under 
development.
